# IBM Courier

This is IBM’s digital form of Courier, in TTF and other modern
formats, with coding-friendly variants.

IBM created a digitized version of Courier and gave the fonts in
PostScript Type 1 format to the X Consortium for distribution under
the permissive [IBM/MIT X Consortium Courier Typefont
Agreement](COPYRIGHT).  **This package retains that copyright and
distribution terms.**

The slashed-zero and dotted-zero variants also contain the following
coding-friendly features:

-   An altered lowercase “L”.
-   A heightened tilde (“~”) for better visibility.
-   Removed the fi, fl, ffi, ffl, and fff ligatures.

## What’s Included

Weights included are the typical four:

-   Regular
-   Italic
-   Bold
-   Bold Italic

There are 12 fonts (individual weights and variants) in total.

Formats are:

-   TTF
-   OTF
-   SVG
-   WOFF
-   WOFF2

These fonts do not contain additional hinting.  Windows will render
them differently from Courier New.

Courier New also has significantly more comprehensive Unicode
coverage.

## Why?

I created this package because I wanted one that’s as faithful
(presumably) to IBM’s original Courier as possible.

## Versus Other Couriers

Let’s compare IBM Courier with four other ones:

-   IBM Courier, this Courier.

-   [Courier New](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/courier-new),
    supplied with Windows, a thinner and also flat-terminated Courier.

-   [Courier Prime](https://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/) is a
    thicker, flat/rounded variant.  The authors also provide
    sans-serif variants, and it has an actual italic!

-   Bitstream Courier 10 Pitch, a thicker, rounded variant, was also
    provided to the X Consortium.

-   [Courier Code](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/courier-code)
    is Bitstream’s variant with a few modifications for coding.

## About

The fonts, as distributed with X11, already contained “hidden”
slashed-zero and dotted-zero characters.  I created and added the
altered lowercase “L” and hightened tilde, made the slashed and dotted
zeroes the default in the coding variants, and removed the ligatures.

The “Courier” **name** and typeface **design** are in the public
domain, though individual fonts (software implementations of that
design) are available under varying licenses.

## The Future

I may add additional characters sporadically.
